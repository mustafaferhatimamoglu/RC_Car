# RC Car Project - Time Plan

This document outlines the detailed time plan for the RC Car Project, including tasks and milestones to ensure steady progress.

## **Phase 1: Clone and Improve**

### **Completed Phases**
1. Analyzed and disassembled the RC car to understand mechanical components.
   - Measured parts and documented findings.
### **Current Tasks**
- Continue modeling the chassis, wheels, and axles in SolidWorks.
- Conduct test prints and refine designs based on results.
### **Next Steps**
1. **Electronics and Remote Controller**
   - Design the circuit for the remote controller in Proteus.
   - Assemble and solder the circuit on a perforated plaque.
   - Program ESP32 modules for two-way communication.
   - Integrate electronics with the car chassis and perform system tests.

2. **Documentation**
   - Share progress and lessons learned through Medium articles.
   - Update GitHub repository with the latest designs and files.
