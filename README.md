# RC_Car
Design and build a 1:32 scale RC car with iterative enhancements. Includes mechanical modeling in SolidWorks, electronics design in Proteus, ESP32-based communication, and advanced features 

RC Car Project

Welcome to the RC Car Project repository! This project aims to design, build, and enhance a 1:32 scale RC car over multiple iterations, pushing the boundaries of performance and functionality. Each phase of the project will be meticulously documented to encourage collaboration and learning.

Project Goals

Phase 1: Clone and Improve

Clone an existing RC car by replicating its mechanical parts in SolidWorks.

Use a 3D printer (Ender V3 Pro) to produce the parts.

Enhance the remote controller with adjustable throttle and steering levels using ESP32 modules for two-way communication.

Phase 2: Advanced Features

Introduce AI control to optimize performance and reduce lap times.

Implement independent steering for each wheel.

Add independent motors and steering for all four wheels.

Documentation and Sharing

Share progress and learnings through weekly Medium articles.

Maintain this repository as a central hub for project files, designs, and updates.

Current Status

Day 6: Mechanical Design Phase

Focus: Designing the chassis in SolidWorks.

Next Steps: Complete the chassis model, start designing wheels and axles, and prepare for 3D printing.

Project Workflow

Mechanical Design

Use SolidWorks for CAD modeling.

Ensure precise dimensions and compatibility of parts.

Test and refine 3D-printed components.

Electronics and Communication

Design circuits in Proteus.

Assemble and test components on perforated plaques.

Implement and test two-way communication with ESP32 modules.

Assembly and Testing

Integrate mechanical and electronic components.

Conduct iterative testing for performance tuning.

Advanced Development

Add AI control for performance optimization.

Develop independent steering and motor control systems.
